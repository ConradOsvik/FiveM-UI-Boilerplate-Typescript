## File structure

The file structure is pretty simple.
Inside the **development** folder is all the important files.
Inside **\_\_client\_\_** you can find **client.ts**, this is where you write client code.
Inside **\_\_server\_\_** you can find **server.ts**, this is where you write server code.
inside **src** is where you find your frontend files, these can be sorted just like you want.

When you build the project, **\_\_client\_\_**, **\_\_server\_\_** and **src** files gets compiled into a **dist** folder
